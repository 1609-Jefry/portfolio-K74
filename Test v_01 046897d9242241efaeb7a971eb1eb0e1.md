# Project Description:

> What is a suitable model to predict energy use and production of a “Zero At The Meter” dwelling, one day in advance with hourly resolution.

*During the start of the project I've noticed that I was not on the same page with my team concerning the actual goal of this project. Most of them seemed to focus too much on part two, ignoring part one. However part one should be our only focus until we have finished it, since our problem owner is as much after part one as he is after part two. By continuously pointing my team members to the actual goal we finally came to the same vision of the project.*

The project is divided in two parts:

**Part one** is to predict the energy production and energy consumption one day in advance with a resolution of one hour.

If we are done with this and we have weeks to spare, we can go to the next stage ourselves.

**Part two** is to create a model that finds the optimal usage of the energy produced by the solar panels. We do this because at the moment you get paid for selling your energy to the net. In 1-2 years they won't do this, they might even fine people for selling energy when the net is overloaded. So the energy needs to be intelligently bought and sold.

- Do we need it the next day?
- Is it profitable to sell it now and buy energy for a lower price later?

Part two was never realised, however the problem owner seemed more than happy with the final results of this project.

### Terminology used within this portfolio:

**Irradiance:** 
The amount of solar radiation received by a unit area

**Pair Programming:** 
When working on the same script with two people there is often a clear distinction between two roles: 
- The **Driver** who is typing in the code, 
- the **Navigator** who is looking ahead and offering help when needed.

**KNMI:**
Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut

**Weather data:**
 measurements of a weather station located somewhat close to the houses.
