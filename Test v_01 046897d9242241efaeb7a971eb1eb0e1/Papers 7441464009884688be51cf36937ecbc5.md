- Abstract

    > It is important for building owners and operators to manage the electrical energy consumption of their buildings. As electrical energy is the major form of energy consumed in a commercial building, the ability to forecast electrical energy consumption in a building will bring great beneﬁts to the building owners and operators. This paper provides a review of the building electrical energy consumption forecasting methods which include the conventional and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods. The signiﬁcant goal of this study is to review, recognize, and analyse the performance of both methods for forecasting of electrical energy consumption. Compared to using a single method of forecasting, the hybrid of two forecasting methods can possibly be applied for more precise results. Regarding this potential, the swarm intelligence (SI) method has been reviewed to be hybridized with AI. Published literature presented in this paper shows that, the hybrid of SVM and SI methods has indeed presented superior performance for forecasting building electrical energy consumption.

### Methods they recommend:

- SVM in combination with SI

# Short-term energy use prediction of solar-assisted water heating system:

- Abstract

    > With improved insulation of building envelopes and the use of low-temperature space heating systems, the share of energy use for domestic hot water (DHW) production in buildings has increased significantly, and nearly become the most energy-expensive service in modern buildings. Early prediction of the energy use for DHW is required for many advanced applications such as smart control, demand-side management, and optimal operation of electric or heat storage. However, predicting energy use of the solar-assisted water heating system is more challenging than typical DHW systems, as it is strongly affected by two stochastic phenomena, demand pattern and solar radiation. Given the increasing use of solar-assisted water heating systems, this paper aims to evaluate the potential to predict energy use in such systems using a novel machine learning approach. In this novel model, a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is enhanced by (1) implementing the attention mechanism, a recent development in deep learning inspired by human vision to pay selective attention to the input data, and (2) decomposition of input data into sub-layers. The performance of simple LSTM neural network, Attention-based LSTM neural network (ALSTM) and Attention-based LSTM using decomposed data (ALSTM-D) are compared to a Feed-Forward neural network as a baseline model. Results show that LSTM, ALSTM and ALSTM-D models have a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 25%, 28% and 41% lower than Feed-Forward model, respectively. These results indicate the superior performance of the proposed ALSTM-D model over conventional models for solar-assisted DHW systems.

# Short-term Time Series Data Prediction of Power Consumption Based on Deep Neural Network

[Paper pdf](Papers%207441464009884688be51cf36937ecbc5/Paper%20pdf%20860883c410d242c68ccca0d7313a5b51.md)

- Abstract

    > Under the background of the rapid development of Internet technology and the popularity of smart grids, the analysis and prediction of short-term time series data of users' power consumption has important guiding significance for grid planning, management decision of economic sector and optimization and allocation of power resources. Considering that the traditional statistical-based time series analysis method is weak in generality and can not handle the complex linear problem in prediction, the long-term dependence of the ordinary cyclic neural network model is insufficient, and the time series data has multidimensional problems, a deep neural network is proposed. The PCA-LSTM model is used for time series data prediction. The model firstly uses the PCA (principal component analysis) method to reduce the dimensionality of the electricity consumption time series data, optimizes the number of input variables, and inputs the data into the long- and short-term memory network LSTM for training prediction. The experimental results show that the LSTM network prediction based on PCA improves the accuracy of short-term time series data prediction, and also improves the convergence speed of LSTM network. It proves that the method has better prediction performance and versatility.
